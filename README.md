# python-train-chat-bots

## Ask about me
This project was created to implement a simple chat bot to answer questions about me. 

The training data is in `intent.json`. I  used `nlkt`, `keras` and `tensorflow` to create this simple bot. The code for bot can be found in `Learning Deep Learning with Chatbot.ipynb`.


## WW2 answering machine

The `ww2-answers/WorldWarIIAnsweringMachine.ipynb` contains code for a simple model that reads the data from the Wrold War II wikipedia page and answers the questions about the world war II.
